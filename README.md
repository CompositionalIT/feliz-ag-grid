### Migration guides

#### v1 to v2

##### Import AG Grid style sheets

To give you better control of your bundle, Feliz.AgGrid no longer imports styles for you, so you will need to include
appropriate imports yourself. For example, add the following lines to your client code to import the necessary styles
and the Balham theme.

```fsharp
importAll "ag-grid-community/styles/ag-grid.css"
importAll "ag-grid-community/styles/ag-theme-balham.css"
```

##### Use new API

Many properties have been updated to more closely reflect the AG Grid docs. In particular, functions like
valueFormatter, valueSetter and cellRenderer now take single-parameter functions, with that parameter having properties
on it allowing you to access the data that you need. This makes it easier for you to get started from the AG Grid docs.

For example, rather than `ColumnDef.cellRenderer` giving you the value in the cell, you are now given a params object
that has a `.value` field.

```diff
-                                                     ColumnDef.cellRenderer (fun x _ ->
+                                                     ColumnDef.cellRenderer (fun rendererParams ->
                                                          Html.span [
                                                              Html.span [
                                                                  prop.style [ style.fontSize 9 ]
                                                                  prop.children [ Html.text "üèÖ" ]
                                                              ]
-                                                             Html.textf "%i" x
+                                                             Html.text $"%i{rendererParams.value}"
                                                          ])
```
